Kevin has a fair amount of experience

chris's layout is really nice, got the blocks to work pretty well

need to pay close attention in git when we initialize

you can work in a branch instead of main when you're wanting to test a number
of things. In that case, you'll push your updates to the branch instead of to main,
and then you can merge the branch into main when you're ready

we went through setting up new directory with git repository initialized in a new folder,
doing this all through terminal

you can run the connection from local to github any time after initializing the repo and
making it on github

this is the git add remote origin command
